# Advice

It is a web application that shows to the user simple advices. The user clicks in the button and other advice is shown.


## How it works?

I use React in the project and an [API](https://api.adviceslip.com/advice). There is a component because it is a simple application.
There are some animation, and the picture in the background is mine. I took that photo in Paris, August 2019. You can use it for personal projects.
  


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
